# Unified Cyberdeck Controller - Solution Documentation

## Problem Solved
The I2C multiplexer (TCA9548A) conflict between OLED display and servo controller has been resolved by implementing a single-process architecture that manages both devices.

## Solution Architecture

### Single Process Design
Instead of running separate processes for OLED and servo that fight over the multiplexer, we now have:
- **One Python process** (`unified_cyberdeck_controller.py`) managing everything
- **Thread-safe multiplexer control** with proper locking mechanisms
- **Background encoder polling** that doesn't interfere with OLED animations

## Key Components

### 1. Unified Controller (`unified_cyberdeck_controller.py`)
- Main controller class managing both devices
- Multiplexer switching with thread locks
- OLED animation runs in main thread at 20 FPS
- Encoder polling runs in background thread
- Event queue for thread communication

### 2. Startup Script (`startup-scripts/unified-cyberdeck.sh`)
- Kills any existing processes
- Changes to correct directory for imports
- Launches unified controller

## How It Works

1. **Initialization**
   - Controller initializes multiplexer manager
   - Switches to channel 0, initializes OLED
   - Switches to channel 1, initializes servo
   - Starts encoder polling thread

2. **Runtime Operation**
   - Main loop updates OLED animation frames
   - Encoder thread detects rotation/clicks
   - When servo needs updating:
     - Acquire mux lock
     - Switch to channel 1
     - Update servo
     - Switch back to channel 0
     - Release lock

3. **Thread Safety**
   - `mux_lock` ensures only one operation at a time
   - `servo_lock` protects angle updates
   - Event queue prevents race conditions

## Configuration

Uses existing config files:
- `servo_control/screen_tilt/config.json` - Servo settings
- `servo_control/screen_tilt/position_state.json` - Saved positions

## Usage

### Manual Start
```bash
cd /home/morph/01_Code/Cyberdeck-Code
./startup-scripts/unified-cyberdeck.sh
```

### Autostart
Add to your autostart configuration:
```bash
/home/morph/01_Code/Cyberdeck-Code/startup-scripts/unified-cyberdeck.sh
```

## Benefits

1. **No Race Conditions** - Single process owns the multiplexer
2. **Guaranteed State** - Always know which channel is active  
3. **Clean Architecture** - All logic in one place
4. **Reliable** - No timing-dependent bugs
5. **Efficient** - No inter-process communication overhead

## Testing Results

✅ OLED animation runs smoothly at 20 FPS
✅ Encoder rotation updates servo correctly
✅ Both work simultaneously without conflicts
✅ No devices "die" during operation
✅ Clean startup and shutdown

## Troubleshooting

If issues occur:
1. Check I2C devices: `i2cdetect -y 1`
2. Verify multiplexer at 0x70
3. Check OLED on channel 0 (0x3C)
4. Check PCA9685 on channel 1 (0x40)
5. Review logs for initialization errors
